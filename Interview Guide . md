# Background

Interviewers are recruited interracially, drawn from a wide array of backgrounds, communicating in scores of languages and united by the mission to document the stories of the witnesses before their memories were lost to history. For Open Life Sciences, all interviewers are welcomed. The diversity of backgrounds and experience among the interviewers helped make the archive richer.
Prior to an interview, an interviewer will arrange an in-person meeting to fill out the survivor’s pre-interview questionnaire. This face-to-face conversation is a way to begin building rapport, describing the purpose and general shape of the interview, and to answer questions. The questionnaire itself calls for detailed biographical information, including birthplace, family background and names, religious and other affiliations. It asks about the survivor’s life, defining wartime experiences, and postwar life right up to the time of the meeting. This discovery process ensures that the interviewer has a good understanding of the context of the particular survivor experience
Whenever possible, interviews are conducted in survivor’s own homes to help them feel at ease. Interviews are conducted in three-parts: early life, 1992 Homeland War experiences, and post war life. In describing experiences of growing up, many individuals share memories of food, culture, religious life, and tradition. Taken together, these interviews reflect a lifetime of perspective – a self-portrait of a whole person - rather than a life entirely dominated by the Holocaust or other genocide.#The Intervieew
The start of an interview is “slated” with the date, survivor and interviewer name, location and language of the interview. Slated means written on a white board for visual documentation. When the camera moves off the slate, we see the interviewer kneeling next to the seated survivor, reading aloud the information on the slate. The interviewer then takes a seat and asks a standard set of biographical questions to start things off. Interviewers will begin an interview with a few questions, and as the conversation progresses, they try not to interrupt. Survivors are encouraged to tell their story organically, engaging in the three main theme areas

## Photos and Other Artifacts 
Interviewers are welcomed and encouraged to bring photographs and other artifacts from their involvement in the Homeland war. 

## Photos 
Interviewees are encouraged to assemble photographs and memorabilia – scrapbooks, clippings, awards, letters, official documents, clothing, or other artifacts from the period – to document on camera. These artifacts in themselves constitute an enormous and valuable archive of their lives. Many portraits depict parents or other relatives and friends that did not survive. This image archive totals more than half a million items and is a significant historical resource.

## Artwork 
Individuals in the Croatian-American Repository choose to share their art – a living, emotional, expression of the impact of genocide and a declaration of the human spirit.

## Documents
Interviewees are encouraged to include documents when giving testimony. USC Shoah Foundation has been entrusted with birth and death certificates, policy papers, family trees, and photographs, and court papers that are now accessible for research and education.

## Clothing
Interviewees highlight articles of clothing and offer descriptions of what it felt like to wear particular items: a prisoner’s uniform, a wedding dress, a travel coat.
